Code for a Unity project for the Congressional App Challenge

This is the code for a 2D platformer in which you play as a blue square running away from lava. The objective is to get 
as high as you can.

In the standard mode, you win by getting to the height 150, and in the hardcore and endless modes there is no goal height.

This game went on to win our district's Congressional App Challenge, and was featured on local news several times.
Congressman David Kustoff also came to our high school to congratulate us on the game.

The game was designed to be entertaining while being simple enough to easily get involved in the game. We used
Aseprite to develop the sprites, Unity was used as the game engine, and the soundtrack was recorded using Reason 10
Intro.

All of the code for this game was written in C# in Visual Studio.
